For my own information: How I built this API:

First, I created my .rb file.  In the file I require the gems Sinatra, and
multi_json.

Next, I made the Gemfile in which I specify the Ruby version to use as well as
the gems being used.

After this is all done, I needed to bundle install, which generates my
Gemfile.lock

Once this is all done, I needed to deploy the app onto Heroku.

For this I needed a config.ru (rack up). Easy and standard configuration
The first line helps load Rubygems, Sinatra, pretty much all of what we need.
The second line tells rack to run the Sinatra app, which will run my server.rb


That's it, these other files were created to help with some warnings, mainly
on windows systems.
